# Exact-Change

This is a Java program that prompts the user to enter an amount of change, and then outputs the fewest number of coins needed to make that change. The program uses a series of if and else-if statements to determine the number of each type of coin required. The program reads input from the user using a Scanner object. The values of different types of coins are represented using variables, and the program uses the modulo operator to calculate the remaining change after each type of coin is subtracted from the total. The program includes multiple nested else-if statements and switch statements, making it more complex than necessary.
